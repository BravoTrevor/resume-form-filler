The Problem
The modern job hunt is a numbers game, often requiring dozens or even hundreds of applications. While each job is unique, the process of applying involves a significant amount of repetitive data entry. Job seekers spend countless hours manually copying and pasting the same information—name, contact details, work history, education, skills—from their resume into slightly different web forms for each application. This tedious process drains time and mental energy that could be better spent on high-value activities like networking, preparing for interviews, or strategically tailoring resumes and cover letters.
The Solution: How EasyApply Helps
EasyApply is a browser extension that automates the most repetitive parts of the job application process, acting as a smart assistant that lives right in your browser. It securely stores your professional profile and uses it to intelligently fill out application forms with a single click.
More than just a form-filler, EasyApply leverages AI to analyze job descriptions directly from a URL, providing you with actionable insights to craft a more compelling application. It helps you understand what recruiters are really looking for, so you can highlight the right skills and experience.
Core Features
Based on the project's foundational requirements, EasyApply is designed to accomplish the following:
AI-Powered Job Analysis:
Paste a job listing URL into the extension.
EasyApply's AI backend analyzes the page content to extract key information:
Key Responsibilities: The main duties of the role.
Required & Preferred Skills: A clear list of "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves."
Stand-Out Factors: An AI-generated summary of what it takes to be a top candidate, based on the job description's tone and specific wording.
Intelligent Form Filling:
Securely store your comprehensive professional profile within the extension, including contact info, work experience, education, skills, certifications, and links.
With one click, automatically fill out application forms on various job portals.
Handles complex fields, such as split phone number inputs with country code dropdowns.
Resume & Cover Letter Tailoring (Future Vision):
Uses the insights from the AI Job Analysis to provide suggestions on how to tailor your existing resume.
Generates a first draft of a targeted cover letter based on a user-provided template, ensuring the content is relevant to the specific job.
Application Submission Assistance (Future Vision):
While always leaving the final "submit" click to the user, EasyApply aims to streamline the entire process up to that point, including handling file uploads for resumes, cover letters, and certificates where possible.
Centralized Profile Management:
An intuitive popup UI allows for easy management of all your professional data.
Dynamically add or remove entries for work experience, education, and more. All data is stored locally on your machine for privacy and security.
How It's Built: The Technology Stack
EasyApply uses a modern client-server architecture to combine a user-friendly browser interface with powerful backend AI processing.
Frontend (Browser Extension):
Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
Platform: Chrome Browser Extension (Manifest V3)
APIs: Chrome Extension APIs (chrome.storage, chrome.tabs, chrome.scripting), DOM Manipulation APIs
Data Format: JSON for structuring and storing user profile data locally.
Backend (AI Service):
Framework: Python with Flask (or Node.js with Express)
Functionality: Provides a secure REST API endpoint for the extension to call.
Core AI Tool: Leverages a powerful URL-context-aware Large Language Model (LLM) to fetch and analyze the content of job listing URLs.
Deployment: Designed to be run locally for development or deployed to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) for production.
Project Goals & Vision
This project was born from a desire to solve a real-world frustration. The primary goal is to empower job seekers by giving them back their most valuable asset: time. By automating the low-value, repetitive tasks, EasyApply allows users to focus their energy on what truly matters—showcasing their unique qualifications and making a genuine connection with potential employers.
Our vision is for EasyApply to become an indispensable assistant for any job seeker, evolving from a form-filler to a comprehensive application strategy tool.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run EasyApply on your local machine for development and testing.
Prerequisites
Google Chrome browser
Python 3.x and pip installed (for the backend service)
A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
Installation
Clone the Repository:
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EasyApply.git
cd EasyApply
Set up the Backend:
Navigate to the backend directory.
Install the required Python packages:
code
Bash
pip install Flask Flask-CORS
(Optional) Add your LLM API key to the environment or configuration file as needed.
Run the backend server:
code
Bash
python backend.py
The backend should now be running locally, typically on http://localhost:5000.
Install the Chrome Extension:
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.
Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner.
Click the "Load unpacked" button.
Select the extension sub-directory from the cloned repository.
The EasyApply extension icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar.
Usage
Start the Backend: Ensure your local backend server is running.
Configure Your Profile: Click the EasyApply icon in your toolbar to open the popup. Fill in your professional details and click "Save All Details". Your information is saved locally.
Analyze a Job: Find a job listing online, copy its URL, paste it into the "Job Analysis" section of the popup, and click "Analyze Job". The extension will communicate with the backend to fetch and display key insights about the role.
Fill an Application: Navigate to an online job application form. Open the EasyApply popup and click the "Fill Current Form" button. The extension will automatically populate the fields it recognizes.
Review and Submit: Always review the auto-filled information for accuracy. Fill in any remaining fields manually, and then submit the application yourself.
Future Roadmap
Full Resume & Cover Letter Tailoring: Integrate the AI analysis with the user's profile to suggest specific resume edits and draft targeted cover letters.
User-Defined Mappings: Allow users to "teach" the extension about new or unrecognized form fields.
Enhanced Field Support: Add more robust support for complex form elements like date pickers and file uploads.
Cloud Deployment: Create a production-ready version of the backend service hosted on a cloud platform.
Optional Data Syncing: Implement chrome.storage.sync as an option for users who want their profile data available across multiple devices.
